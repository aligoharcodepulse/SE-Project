📌 Project Summary — CattleCare Pro

The proposed smart livestock management system, CattleCare Pro, advances cattle farm operations by adopting a modern approach in place of traditional manual exercises using a digitized solution. System will offer single admin dashboard to track cattle movement, monitor shelter security, and handle routine farm activities with efficiency.

Traditionally, farmers depended on manual observation and methods like tying bells to cattle in order to track their movement/location when they left the shelter to graze; this was very inaccurate and time-consuming. CattleCare Pro offers convenience by allowing real-time tracking of cattle outside to ensure that they stay within safe boundaries. The system also helps in monitoring shelter conditions and even monitors unusual activities like cattle fighting for better livestock safety and security.

This system will reduce the manual workload in farm management, eliminate information loss, provide timely monitoring of cattle, and ensure better decision-making. CattleCare Pro enables farm owners to obtain an organized digital overview of relevant data about their cattle, enhancing productivity, security, and efficiency in farm operations.
